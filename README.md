# device-runtime-py

This repository holds the python implementation of the Device Runtime. The Device Runtime provides a SDK to enable the devices to communicate with the COGNIT platform to perform the task offloading. This component communicates with the Provisioning Engine to request/delete/update a Serverless Runtime and, then, it communicates with the provided Serverless Runtime to perform the offloading of functions and the uploading of content to the data-service.
